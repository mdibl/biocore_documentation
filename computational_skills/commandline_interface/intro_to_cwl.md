## Learning Objectives

* Acquire a surface-level understanding of the Common Workflow Language
* Become familiar with editing YAML/JSON files
* Learn how to execute common bioinformatics analysis tools such as FastQC and Trim_Galore on the command line, through the use of CWL scripts and a configuration file

## Summary

The analysis work we do in the MDIBL Computational Core can be boiled down to a few key components/tools/languages, two of which we will be discussing today (CWL and JSON/YAML)

## CWL

In a nutshell, the Common Workflow Language (also known as CWL), serves as a medium in which to write descriptions of existing command line programs and tools, and then to string those descriptions into functional workflows

The language requires you to preemptively record inputs and expected outputs, but can be very flexible in what it accepts, and what results are given
* The main benefit of using this language is its incredible portability, re-usability, and scalability

Instead of having to deal with the environment of your host machine to run your analysis / execute your tool, you can use integrated Docker calls to download and configure images of your tool at runtime
  * To launch a pipeline written in CWL, you only need to have CWLTool and Docker installed
  * Important to note, edits do need to be made to the accompanying YAML/JSON configuration file to properly pass in whatever files and program parameters you want to run your pipeline with.
  * However, you only need to do this once, and once edited, you have a saved record of what settings you used, and what tools, in what order, and which files were provided for input

Because of the above attributes, CWL has seen adoptions in fields such as Astronomy, Machine Learning, and Bioinformatics

**This tutorial assumes that you already have CWLTool and Docker installed locally or on a remote machine**

## YAML/JSON

These are human-readable data transfer languages, and interchangeable with one another (serve the same purpose, syntactically similar)

### JSON Example
```json
{
  "genomeDir": {
    "class": "Directory",
    "path": "/data/transformed/STAR-2.6.1b/ensembl/release-93/danio_rerio-genome"
  },
  "fq1": {
    "class": "File",
    "path": "/data/internal/JimCoffman/jcoffman_006.abOnly_cortisol_2018/0AB1_S1_LALL_R1_001.fastq.gz"
  },
  "fq2": {
    "class": "File",
    "path": "/data/internal/JimCoffman/jcoffman_006.abOnly_cortisol_2018/0AB1_S1_LALL_R2_001.fastq.gz"
  },
  "nthreads": 8
}
```
### YAML Example
```yaml
genomeDir:
  class: Directory
  path: "/data/transformed/STAR-2.6.1b/ensembl/release-93/danio_rerio-genome"
fq1:
  class: File
  path: "/data/internal/JimCoffman/jcoffman_006.abOnly_cortisol_2018/0AB1_S1_LALL_R1_001.fastq.gz"
fq2:
  class: File
  path: "/data/internal/JimCoffman/jcoffman_006.abOnly_cortisol_2018/0AB1_S1_LALL_R2_001.fastq.gz"
nthreads: 8
```

## Editing Configuration Files

Before we can start working with CWL directly, it's important to first get a grasp on how to edit the configuration files needed to successfully execute a wrapped tool
* As mentioned above, they can be written in either the JSON or YAML language
* To access the scripts and config files for this tutorial, clone the biocore_documentation repository found [here](https://github.com/mdibl/biocore_documentation)
  1. To clone, simply click the `Clone` button on the main repo page, and copy the link provided in the `Clone with HTTPS` box
  2. Next, open up the terminal, navigate to where you'd like to place these tutorial/documentation files on your remote machine using `cd`, and type the following
  3. `Git clone` followed by pasting the repo link you copied earlier
  
* Once you've cloned the repository, `cd` into `biocore_documentation`
  * Then `cd` into `cwl_tutorial_files`
  * From there, `cd` into `configuration`
  * To view the contents of this directory, use the `ls -al` command
  * Here you will see a couple tool-specific YAML files, including ones for FastQC and trim_galore
  * The easiest (well, quickest) way to edit these files is through a built-in text-editing program such as `nano`

### Using nano

* To edit the YAML file, type `nano` followed by a space, and then the name of the file you want to edit: `FastQC-test.yaml` into the command line
  * This will open the file in the nano text editor
* At the top of the page are the contents of the file, and at the bottom, the list of commands available to you
  * Use the arrow keys to move to the line that says `path: "/compbio/data/test_fastq/KO_cort2.fastq"`
  * Move along the length of the line to `/KO_cort2.fastq`
  * Edit the path so that instead of reading `/KO_cort2.fastq`, it reads `/KO_cort1.fastq`
* Once that change has been made, use the control (`ctrl`/`^`) and `o` keys to write out
  * Type `y` to save the changes you made to the file
* Exit the nano text editor by using control (`ctrl`/`^`) and `x` keys
  * **if you make any accidental edits to the file (and you don't remember what they were before), you can exit without saving by using control (`ctrl/^`) and `x`, followed by `n` for "no, I do not want to save changes".**
    * If something gets *really* borked, it may be best to just delete the cloned repository, re-clone it using the steps above, and try again :)

Great! You've successfully edited a configuration file!

Now we can use the CWL-wrapped FastQC tool to generate a quality report of a read file.

## FastQC

* FastQC is a widely used tool that conducts quality control checks on sequence data generated by HTS
* Capable of generating HTML reports from BAM, SAM, and/or FastQ files
* Provides a descriptive overview highlighting where there may exist problems in your data
* Can be ran either as a GUI program, or completely on the command line
  
### Executing FastQC via CWL

Before we run our CWL script, we first want to create a named directory for our analysis.

* `cd` into the `/compbio/analysis` directory
  * then use the `mkdir` command to create a named directory for your output
  * i.e `mkdir nmaki/fastqc-test/etc`
* `cd` into your new directory, and you're now ready to execute some CWL code
  * on a side note, you can also create tool specific directories such as `fastqc-test` to avoid clutter, but it's up to personal preference
  
* To launch the FastQC tool with the configuration file we edited, use the following command:
  * `cwltool ~/biocore_documentation/cwl_tutorial_files/code/FastQC.cwl ~/biocore_documentation/cwl_tutorial_files/configuration/FastQC-test.yaml`
* This uses CWLtool to invoke FastQC, and pass in required inputs via YAML file
* `~/` refers to your home directory, and the rest are just the locations of the two files in the repository
    * `cwltool commandlinetool.cwl config.yaml`

As the sample sequences are fairly small in size, the run should complete quickly.

You can now use `ls -al` to view the generated files

To unzip the FastQC output, use the `unzip` command, followed by the name of the zipped directory.

If you were to just run FastQC by itself, without CWL, the equivalent command would look something like this: `fastqc ../../../data/test_fastq/KO_cort1.fastq`

Seems straightforward right? You may be wondering, "why go through the hassle of having these scripts, modifying a configuration file, if this is all you really need to do?".

Well, CWL works best with programs that are slightly more involved, and that require more inputs/outputs to run completely (see: our next tool).

## trim_galore

* trim_galore combines the quality control program Cutadapt with FastQC
  * Cutadapt finds and removes adapter sequences, primers, and other unwanted sequence type from HTS read files
    * (This helps improve the quality of your input reads, before conducting full-fledged analysis)
* Consistent quality and adapter trimming on FastQ files
* After running Cutadapt, FastQC is ran on the trimmed reads, and a report generated
  * While not completely necessary, it does provide an additional point of comparison between the two reports; pre and post trimming

### Executing trim_galore via CWL

Running trim_galore with CWL is done in the same manner as FastQC

* `cd` into the directory where you want your results to be stored
* To launch the trim_galore tool with the appropriate configuration file, use the following command:
  * `cwltool  ~/biocore_documentation/cwl_tutorial_files/code/trim_galore.cwl ~/biocore_documentation/cwl_tutorial_files/configuration/trim_galore_se-test.yaml` 

While that command mirrors the previous one, the equivalent command without CWL is a bit different: 
* `trim_ galore -f fastq -e 0.1 -q 20 -O 1 -a AGATCGGAAGAGC /var/lib/cwl/stgb4e72ffe-0f77-4d9b-86a4-24bc1d82bdf4/KO_cort1.fastq`
  * If you were to examine the YAML configuration file, you'd find that there are only a few inputs being passed in to trim_galore through CWL
  * Many of the inputs you see above (-f, -e, -q, etc) are all included in the CWL file itself, as defaults
    * This allows you to have a relatively simple configuration file that only passes in what it needs to
    * It also means that there is a running record of the options you used for your programs execution, baked right into the CWL and YAML code
* To explore the output from your trim_galore run, simply use `ls -al` in your output directory

### Single End / Paired End

When working with high-throughput sequencing read files, you'll often come across them in one of two configurations

* Single End: DNA is sequenced from one end only, is simpler and more efficient than Paired End sequencing, and works best for smaller RNA-Seq or ChIP-Seq.

* Paired End: DNA is sequenced from both ends (doubles read files), allows for generation of higher quality sequence data (more accurate read alignments, indel variant detection), gene fusions, and novel transcript identification.

Commonly, CWL tools and configuration files are "duplicated" with this in mind; discriminating between SE and PE with _se or _pe appended after the tool/config filename
