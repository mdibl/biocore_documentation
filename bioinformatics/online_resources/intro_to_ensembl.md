# Introduction to Ensembl

## Learning Objectives

## Summary

* Ensembl acts as a vast repository of reference genomes and annotations for a wide range of organisms, including Human, Mouse, C. Elegans, and Zebrafish
* Mostly dedicated to model organisms, but does contain resources for a number of non-model species
* Primarily focused on vertebrates, Ensembl Genomes extends across to non-vertebrates, and includes Plants, Fungi, and Bacteria

Ensembl annotates a large swath of data onto its genome assemblies, first type is Gene Models(builds)

## Gene Models

Comprised of: 

International Nucleotide Sequence databases (ENA, GenBank, DDBJ)
* cDNAs
* ESTs
* RNAseq

NCBI RefSeq
* Manually annotated proteins and MRNAs

Protein Sequence databases
* Swiss-Prot

Sequences from the above resources are aligned to the genome, transcripts clustered from alignments based on overlapping coding sequences

Forms Ensembl genes (automated genome annotation pipeline)

Ensembl genomes can either be automatically or manually annotated (HAVANA for manual)
* Set of genes is known as the Gencode geneset

In addition to gene annotation, other data types are added to genome, including variation data, comparative genomics, and regulatory features
