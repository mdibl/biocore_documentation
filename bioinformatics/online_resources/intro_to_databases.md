# Introduction to Databases

## Learning Objectives

* Learn the differences between Primary and Secondary databases
* Exposure to the wide range of databases available for exploration
* Become familiar with standard use cases for a selection of sites covered

## Summary

Commonly, databases are characterized as either primary or secondary, and this holds true for bioinformatics as it does for other data-rich fields

**Primary databases** are comprised of data that has been experimentally derived, with the results being uploaded directly into the database by researchers

* In our domain for example, the information that is archived is made up of content such as nucleotide or protein sequence, or macromolecular structure
* Once assigned an accession number, the data stored within a primary database becomes static, and is designated a Record
  * Ex: GenBank, ENA, GEO

**Secondary databases** could be considered an "extension" of primary ones, due to their makeup being derived from the analysis of primary data

* Pull from multiple sources, such as other databases, and available scientific literature
* These resources are incredibly complex, combining manual and computational analysis/interpretation, and are very highly curated
* Their primary purpose is to exist as vast repositories of reference material, with detailed data ranging from single genes, to complete and published experimental results
  * Ex: Uniprot, Ensembl, InterPro
