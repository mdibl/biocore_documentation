# Command Line Worksheet

This worksheet is meant to be paired with the lecture on the Command Line interface and it's sister component, Introduction to Bioinformatics Resources

## Tasks

For this lesson, you'll be putting into practice many of the skills you've gained from the preceding lecture. Lets begin!

How do you figure out where you are on the command line?
* Find your current working directory

Transitioning through the filesystem
* Once you know where you are, move into your `Downloads` folder
  * The path may differ a bit between macOS, Linux Distros, and Windows
  * Now may be a good time to practice moving up and down directories, and if you get lost, remember that the `~` command will take you home

Creating a new space
* Once in `Downloads`, create a new directory titled `experimental data`
* Move into it

Downloading from a remote repository
* Using the `wget` command, (link to remote files here)

Exploring File Content
* Once your download has completed, use the terminal command to show all files in your current directory

Exploring variations in data types
